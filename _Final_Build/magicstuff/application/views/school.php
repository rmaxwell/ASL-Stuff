<h1>STUFF’s School Show – Content</h1>
<p>STUFF travels the Central Florida area spreading the excitement of the Orlando Magic brand to elementary schools through his school show, “STUFF’s THREEE Point Play.” That’s not a typo!  We spell THREEE with three E’s because the show focus on the three E’s to becoming a better student…Eat Right, Exercise and Education.</p>
<p>STUFF spreads the message through a 45 minute performance and interactive DVD.  Students get to play a healthy food guessing game with Magic players, get to stand up and dance with STUFF and also get to read a book titled “STUFF’s Game Day.” “STUFF’s THREEE Point Play” is filled with Magic, excitement, entertainment, knowledgeable information and fun!</p>
